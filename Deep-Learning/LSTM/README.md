## Long Short Term Memory:
* **A special kind of RNN’s, capable of Learning Long-term dependencies.**
* LSTM’s have a Nature of Remembering information for a long periods of time is their Default behaviour.

#### LSTM had a three step Process:
* look at the below figure that says Every LSTM module will have 3 gates named as 
   * Forget gate, 
   * Input gate, 
   * Output gate.

#### Forget Gate:
Decides how much of the past you should remember.

#### Update Gate/input gate:
Decides how much of this unit is added to the current state.


#### Output Gate:
Decides which part of the current cell makes it to the output.
