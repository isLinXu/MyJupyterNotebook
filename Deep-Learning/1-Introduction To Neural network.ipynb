    "## Neural Network Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks were one of the first machine learning models.\n",
    "* Deep learning implies the use of neural networks.  \n",
    "* The **\"deep\" ** in deep learning refers to a neural network with many hidden layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks accept input and produce output.  \n",
    "    * The input to a neural network is called the feature vector.  \n",
    "    * The size of this vector is always a fixed length.  \n",
    "    * Changing the size of the feature vector means recreating the entire neural network.  \n",
    "    * A vector implies a 1D array.  Historically the input to a neural network was always 1D.  \n",
    "    * However, with modern neural networks you might see inputs, such as:-\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1D Vector** - Classic input to a neural network, similar to rows in a spreadsheet.  Common in predictive modeling.\n",
    "* **2D Matrix** - Grayscale image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **3D Matrix** - Color image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **nD Matrix** - Higher order input to a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to CNN's, the image input was sent to a neural network simply by squashing the image matrix into a long array by placing the image's rows side-by-side.  CNNs are different, as the nD matrix literally passes through the neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions** The term dimension can be confusing in neural networks.  In the sense of a 1D input vector, dimension refers to how many elements are in that 1D array.  \n",
    "* For example a neural network with 10 input neurons has 10 dimensions.  \n",
    "* However, now that we have CNN's, the input has dimensions too.  \n",
    "* The input to the neural network will *usually* have 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.  4 or more dimensions is unusual.  \n",
    "----------\n",
    "* You might have a 2D input to a neural network that has 64x64 pixels. \n",
    "* This would result in 4,096 input neurons.  \n",
    "* This network is either** 2D or 4,096D, **depending on which set of dimensions you are talking about!\n",
