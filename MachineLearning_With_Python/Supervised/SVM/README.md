* A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile Machine Learning model, capable of performing [linear or nonlinear classification](https://github.com/iAmKankan/MachineLearning_With_Python/blob/master/README.md#linear-classification-vs-non-linear-classification), regression, and even outlier detection. 
* It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, prior to Neural Network for pictures and videos SVM was used intensively.
* SVMs are particularly well suited for classification of complex `small` or `medium-sized` datasets.
