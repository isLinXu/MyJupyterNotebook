    "#### What is Bayes Theorem?\n",
    "* Bayes theorem named after Rev. Thomas Bayes. \n",
    "* It works on conditional probability. \n",
    "* Conditional probability is the probability that something will happen, given that something else has already occurred. * Using the conditional probability, we can calculate the probability of an event using its prior knowledge.\n",

    "\n",
    "* P(H) is the probability of hypothesis H being true. This is known as the prior probability.\n",
    "* P(E) is the probability of the evidence(regardless of the hypothesis).\n",
    "* P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given that hypothesis is true.\n",

    "A Path Lab is performing a Test of disease say “D” with two results “Positive” & “Negative.” They guarantee that their test result is 99% accurate: if you have the disease, they will give test positive 99% of the time. If you don’t have the disease, they will test negative 99% of the time. If 3% of all the people have this disease and test gives “positive” result, what is the probability that you actually have the disease?\n",

    "### 1)  Gaussian Naive Bayes      \n",
    "Here, we assume that the features follow a normal distribution. Instead of discrete counts, we have continuous features (e.g., the popular Iris dataset where the features are sepal width, petal width, sepal length, petal length).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2)  Bernoulli Naive Bayes    \n",
    "The binomial model is useful if your feature vectors are binary (i.e., 0s and 1s). One application would be text classification with a bag of words model where the 0s 1s are \"word occurs in the document\" and \"word does not occur in the document\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3)  MultiNomial Naive Bayes \n",
    "The multinomial naive Bayes model is typically used for discrete counts. E.g., if we have a text classification problem, we can take the idea of bernoulli trials one step further and instead of \"word occurs in the document\" we have \"count how often word occurs in the document\", you can think of it as \"number of times outcome number x_i is observed over the n trials\""
